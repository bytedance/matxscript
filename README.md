Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building MatxScript.
- [TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm): Part of MatxScript's IR and Runtime
  originates from TVM. We also learned and adapted some part of codegen pipeline from TVM.

- [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8): Part of the runtime code comes from cpython for align the semantics

- [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly): We adopted the idea of FBString to design our runtime::string_core

- [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp): The string_view structure and ByteHash algorithm originates from abseil

- [rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson): The json module is implemented based on rapidjson
