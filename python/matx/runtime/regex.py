    """Regular class implemented using pcre.

    Args:
        pattern (str): Str types. Regular expression pattern.
        ignore_case (bool): Booleans. Perform case-insensitive matching. The default is false
        dotall (bool): Booleans. "." matches any character at all, including the newline. The default is false
        extended (bool): Booleans. Most white space in the pattern (other than in a character class), and characters between a # outside a character class and the next newline, inclusive, are ignored. An escaping backslash can be used to include a white space or # character as part of the pattern. The default is false.
        anchored (bool): Booleans. Matches only at the beginning of the subject. The default is false.
        ucp (bool): Booleans. Sequences such as "\\d" and "\\w" use Unicode properties to determine character types, instead of recognizing only characters with codes less than 128 via a lookup table. The default is false.
